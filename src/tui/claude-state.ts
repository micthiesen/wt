/**
 * Theme + glyph mapping for the `DerivedState` values, shared by every
 * surface that displays AI-session state: the details-pane row, the
 * footer slots, the list-pane glyph, and the sessions picker. Single
 * source of truth so a color or glyph change lands in one place.
 *
 * Color is per-harness: each harness keys its own `DerivedState ->
 * color` table via {@link stateColor}. The `working`/`waiting` states
 * carry the harness's brand hue (cyan/orange for claude, indigo for
 * codex, violet for opencode) so a glance reads vendor *and* state. The
 * remaining states stay semantic and shared: `abandoned` is always red
 * (crashed is crashed) and `idle` always dim, while `asking`/`polling`/
 * `unknown` come only from claude's registry — codex/opencode never
 * emit them — so they keep claude's values everywhere for exhaustiveness.
 *
 * The glyph table ({@link STATE_DOT}) stays shared: shape encodes state,
 * color encodes harness + state together.
